# Substrate Account Filter

A [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) pallet for account-level filtering/permissioning.

The pallet maintains a allow-list of accounts that are permitted to submit extrinsics. Sudo (or any other governance mechanism, when supported) could be used to add and remove accounts from this list.

The filtering of incoming extrinsics and their sender accounts is done during the transaction queue validation, using the `SignedExtension` trait.

## Usage

* Add the module's dependency in the `Cargo.toml` of your `runtime` directory. Make sure to enter the correct path or git url of the pallet as per your setup.

```toml
[dependencies.account_filter]
package = 'substrate-account-filter'
git = 'https://github.com/gautamdhameja/substrate-account-filter.git'
default-features = false
```

* Declare the pallet in your `runtime/src/lib.rs`.

```rust
pub use account_filter;

impl account_filter::Config for Runtime {
    type Event = Event;
}

construct_runtime!(
    pub enum Runtime where
        Block = Block,
        NodeBlock = opaque::Block,
        UncheckedExtrinsic = UncheckedExtrinsic
    {
        ...
        ...
        ...
        AccountFilter: account_filter::{Module, Call, Storage, Event<T>, Config<T>},
    }
);
```

* Add the module's `AllowAccount` type in the `SignedExtra` checklist.

```rust
pub type SignedExtra = (
    ...
    ...
    balances::TakeFees<Runtime>,
    account_filter::AllowAccount<Runtime>
```

* Add a genesis configuration for the module in the `src/chain_spec.rs` file. This configuration adds the initial account ids to the account allow-list.

```rust
    use node_template_runtime::{..., AccountFilterConfig};
    ...
    account_filter: Some(AccountFilterConfig {
        allowed_accounts: vec![
            (get_account_id_from_seed::<sr25519::Public>("Alice"), ()),
            (get_account_id_from_seed::<sr25519::Public>("Bob"), ())],
    }),
```

* `cargo build --release` and then `cargo run --release -- --dev`

When the node starts, only the `AccountId`s added in the genesis config of this module will be able to send extrinsics to the runtime. This means that you **should not leave the genesis config empty** or else no one will be able to submit any extrinsics.

New `AccountId`s can be added to the allow-list by calling the pallet's `add_account` function using `root` key as origin.

## Sample

The usage of this pallet are demonstrated in the [Substrate permissioning sample](https://github.com/gautamdhameja/substrate-permissioning).

## Potential extension

* The addition and removal of `AccountId`s to the allow-list can also be done using other governance methods instead of root.
* The logic can be reversed to maintain a deny-list of accounts to prevent those `AccountId`s from sending extrinsics.
